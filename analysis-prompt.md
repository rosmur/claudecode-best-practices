# Analyzing the best methods to use Claude Code

With the given sources written by engineers in @sources.csv (whose content is available in the source_content folder) , analyze the best methods and practices in using Claude Code. 

Process Flow:

1. Separate out content that are general best practices in enginneering/methods/workflows and are applicable to regular coding. (However highlight that these are fundamental). Do however focus on items that are specifically of more imporatnce to coding with agentic AI like Claude Code like CI, Testing, version control etc.

2. Next, organize into logical/semantic areas. Then find items that are repeated in more than one source and highlight them.  

3. Finally, scrutinize the organized information - what makes sense, what doesnt, what is high value/highly recommended and what is low value/not worth the effort etc.

Write this to a report ensuring sufficient depth without excessive verbosity
